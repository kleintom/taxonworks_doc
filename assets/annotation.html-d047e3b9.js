To create one:</p><ul><li>Open the radial annotator for the record in question</li><li>Select <code>Alternate values</code></li><li>Select the type of alternate value (e.g. Abbreviation)</li><li>Select the target field (e.g. <code>title</code> of a source)</li><li>Add the value, and click Create.</li></ul><p><em>Alternate values are not allowed on the <code>name</code> of a TaxonName, don&#39;t even think about requesting this.</em></p><h3 id="identifiers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#identifiers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Identifiers</h3><p>Identifiers are broader subject (i.e. we need further discussion here).

The latter are in essence those types of identifiers that people thought really hard about, and tried to make universally applicable, the former, not so much.</p><p>In the real-world there are no-such-things as &quot;unique&quot; identifiers per <a href="/about/glossary#object">object</a>. TaxonWorks embraces this philosophy by allowing you to add as many identifiers to your data as you want. Identifiers can be used to say and do things like:</p><ul><li>Conceptually, my digital thing is the <code>same_as</code> your digital thing</li><li>If you find my identifier you&#39;ll likely be able to find my thing (e.g. a <code>Identifier::Local::CatalogNumber</code> that represents a physical label <code>localized_to</code> my specimen)</li><li>The same things has two different &quot;unique&quot; identifiers, and that thing is my thing</li><li>I&#39;m tracking (integrating/referencing/relating) this thing in my project, but with minimal detail, you can get more details on this thing if you can find other things &quot;out there&quot; with the same Identifier</li><li>My thing is the Person with this ORCiD (Identifier)</li><li>My thing historically could be found (your results may vary now) with this Identifier</li><li>I want to make labels for my specimens that reference my trip-codes so that I can quickly call them up, print them, assign them to Specimens, etc., and darn it my (Matt&#39;s) &quot;MJY-YYYY&quot; codes do not mean &quot;Mark Jupiter Yahoo&quot;, but I need their (Mark&#39;s) &quot;MJY&quot; codes too.

You <em>should not</em> assume that all notes of are of some type. You should also not use Notes because you want something to appear <em>somewhere</em>, it&#39;s much better to do this with a more defined annotation such as a data attribute.</p><h3 id="verifiers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#verifiers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Verifiers</h3><p>A Verifier is a very generic way of saying &quot;This Person verified this record&quot;.
